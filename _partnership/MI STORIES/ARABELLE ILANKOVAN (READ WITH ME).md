<p>&ldquo;Read with Me&rdquo; is an experience that has definitely changed our perspectives in life. &ldquo;Read with Me&rdquo; is a programme where we taught students of our age from Delta Senior School who have mild intellectual disabilities new words to expand their vocabulary. Throughout this journey, as we helped these students, we could see that they were eager to learn even after a long and tiring day of school. They did not let their disabilities nor their exhaustion stop them from wanting to discover new words each week. Though the words learnt may be simple and easy for us, it can be challenging for them. However, they did not stop trying. Instead, they tried their very best to read and understand the words taught. The positive attitude and passion in their eyes taught many of us to embrace the &lsquo;never give up&rsquo; spirit and to continue to persevere despite the challenging circumstances. We also learnt to always try to put ourselves in the shoes of others and be open-minded so that we will always see the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Though this experience was a memorable one, there were bound to be some challenges. For instance, the main challenge we had faced was communication. For many of us, this may be the first time engaging with students of such disabilities. Thus, it was tough to ensure that the students understood what we were saying and were able to learn something at the end of the session. However, as time passed, we were able to be more comfortable in teaching the students as the students become more responsive to us.</p>
<p>All in all, this was we are grateful to have an opportunity to make a positive difference to the lives of students at Delta Senior School. The project definitely made an impact in our lives too. Through this, we were able to learn that though life may be difficult, there are always people around to help you along the way. Hence, we should never give up so easily and always give our best effort to overcome the obstacles that may come our way.</p>
