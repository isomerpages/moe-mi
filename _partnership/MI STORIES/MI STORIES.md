<p>At Millennia Institute, students cultivate a strong sense of purpose beyond self, ride on a variety of opportunities to learn to be more self-directed (autonomy), and improve on their mastery of knowledge and skills. MI Stories is a collection of stories of Millennians who demonstrate ownership of their learning experience at MI and display MI values as they achieve diverse successes. These stories forms the narrative of our school, capturing what we did yesterday, how that impacts us today, and how we can move forward tomorrow. They also serve to inspire generations of Millennians to strive for the excellence we can all achieve.</p>
