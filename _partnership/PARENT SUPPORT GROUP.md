<p>The MI Parent Support Group (PSG) currently consists of members who share a common vision with the Institute in bringing out the best in every child. Members meet on a regular basis with teachers and school leaders to engage in dialogues. Educational concerns are also discussed with the common aim to provide a conducive and supportive learning environment for the holistic development of students.</p>
<p>Being in the PSG also provides more opportunities for parents to collaborate with the Institute, such as volunteering for major school activities, offering job shadowing attachments for students in their area of expertise, being part of the interview panel to endorse scholarship and awards, as well as providing career guidance in terms of mentoring or talks.</p>
