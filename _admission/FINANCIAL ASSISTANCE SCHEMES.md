<p>Millennia Institute has put in place a process to identify students who need financial assistance. We administer a household survey at the beginning of the year to identify students who qualify for various financial assistance schemes as well as to determine the level of subsidy for enrichment programmes, study trips and purchase of computers via the NEU PC Plus Programme.</p>
<p>There are three broad categories of financial assistance schemes for eligible Millennians. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ministry of Education Financial Assistance Scheme (MOE FAS)</li>
<li>Institute Advisory Committee Financial Assistance Scheme (IAC FAS)</li>
<li>External Bursaries</li>
</ol>
<p>The schemes we offer ensure that none of our students are deprived of any educational opportunities due to financial constraints.</p>
