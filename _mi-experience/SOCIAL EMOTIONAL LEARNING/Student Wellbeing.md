<p>Positive student well-being forms the foundation in developing the MI Learner, Thinker and Leader. By providing an enabling culture and environment through the 6 key enablers (i.e. meaningful shared experiences, supportive network, student empowerment, positive management of student behaviour and early intervention, conducive environment for quality teaching and learning), MI will bring about a strong sense of belonging in our students, promote positive peer relationships and build quality teacher-student relationships. Each of this plays a critical role in enhancing student well-being.</p>
