<h4><strong>A Resilient Footballer and Student Leader</strong></h4>
<p>In my three years in MI, I had many memorable moments but my proudest moments had to be when I received my A-level results and when my football team finished in the top 4 position in the 2018 National Schools 'A' Division Football Championships.</p>
<p>Going for every night study session and staying back to revise while juggling my different commitments were at times very difficult but to know that I was able to pull through makes me really proud of myself. I enjoyed leading as I was not only able to develop and hone my leadership skills but working with like-minded leaders to see through an event from the planning phase to its execution was very meaningful work.</p>
<p>I faced a number of challenges when I came to MI, which really tested my mental resilience especially in the classroom. When I found out that my mother had been diagnosed with an incurable illness, my motivation to study suffered a huge hit as my mother was my main source of motivation.</p>
<p>Another challenge was juggling the many commitments that came along with being a student leader. The various deadlines and expectation to be exemplary was hard as I had to give up much of my personal time. However, knowing that my work was worthwhile gave me the added drive to keep pushing. Through all of this, I was able to depend on the values of resilience and responsibility inculcated since young.</p>
<p>Resilience to me was enduring the hits that life kept giving and chasing the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>Responsibility taught me to be accountable, which spurred me to put in my best effort to produce quality work and results.</p>
<p>However, I would not have achieved any of my accolades without the help of my teachers and friends in MI. My teachers went the extra mile to ensure that I was able to maximise my potential and overcome my setbacks be it through having extra consultations, extending a listening ear or offering words of advice. My friends gave me a much needed respite from the pressures of being a student leader.</p>
<p>In my time in MI, I lived by the mantra "Tired is a state of mind". It helped me endure and push through when it seemed I could not persevere anymore. To my juniors, I hope this mantra helps you stay the course when the going gets tough.</p>
