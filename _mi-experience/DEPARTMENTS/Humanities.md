<h4><strong>Objectives:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>To develop students into self-directed learners with the capacity to learn new areas effectively and independently;</li>
<li>To develop students&rsquo; cross-cultural literacies so that they are able to collaborate across cultures seamlessly to solve problems; and</li>
<li>To develop students&rsquo; way of seeing so that they are better equipped to understand the local, regional and global forces around them.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Key Programmes:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The teaching and learning of the four subjects under the Humanities Department (Art, China Studies in English, Geography and History) are built around two key ideas:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>"The World is My Classroom" exemplifies the school's belief that experiential learning encounters and the real world connection both play a major role in opening students' minds. It reflects the centrality of global awareness and international engagement in the way Art, China Studies in English, Geography and History subjects are explored. Syllabus content is made relevant and current through rigorous reference to case studies. While, differentiated activities and assessments encourage students to stay connected and informed about the way their learning is brought to life in the real world, based on individuals&rsquo; level of readiness and proficiency.<br /><br /></li>
<li>To develop disciplinarity and in preparing our students for higher learning, the department&rsquo;s quintessential inquiry-based learning approach undergirds the teaching of all Humanities subjects. Another focus of the Humanities education at our institute necessitates our students to become future-ready individuals through the infusion of 21st Century skills and competencies and other identified brain-based learning strategies in our pedagogical frameworks. Equipped with an inquiring and critical mind, educators here too believe that we are duty-bound to also identify teachable moments in suitable curricular contexts to inculcate empathy amongst the student body for the world around them.</li>
