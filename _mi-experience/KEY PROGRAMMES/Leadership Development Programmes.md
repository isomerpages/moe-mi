<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>At MI, we hold the belief that every Millennian can and will become a leader who can make a positive change for the betterment of self and others.</p>
<p>Inculcating values and guiding principles in students are the duties of each one of us. In MI, we believe that every student can be developed as leaders who contribute positively to the society. With that in mind, we adopt the Social Change Model (Astin, 1994) to facilitate positive social change in the Institute and the community. It grooms leaders who are able to lead positive change whether they hold traditional roles of leadership, or not. This is in alignment with the school&rsquo;s vision of developing Leaders of values and character and the Desired Outcomes of Education to develop students as an active contributor and a concerned citizen.</p>
<p>Students go through differentiated levels of training and mentoring to prepare them for different levels of leadership responsibilities. As part of the developmental process, students are given opportunities to exercise leadership through formal and ad-hoc leadership appointments. They are also given platforms to reflect on their experiences. In addition, teachers provide students with formative feedback through conversations to affirm their strengths and encourage them to work on their areas for growth.</p>
<h4><strong>Programme Objectives</strong></h4>
<p>The vision behind our work in developing students as leaders is to develop within them 21st Century Competencies. Students go through a self- reflective journey to understand what is involved in leadership, and to assess and develop their own abilities. They grow to be more confident and ready to be leaders of today and tomorrow.</p>
