<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>At MI, we hold the belief that every Millennian can and will become a leader who can make a positive change for the betterment of self and others.</p>
<p>Inculcating values and guiding principles in students are the duties of each one of us. In MI, we believe that every student can be developed as leaders who contribute positively to the society. With that in mind, we adopt the Social Change Model (Astin, 1994) to facilitate positive social change in the Institute and the community. It grooms leaders who are able to lead positive change whether they hold traditional roles of leadership, or not. This is in alignment with the school’s vision of developing Leaders of values and character and the Desired Outcomes of Education to develop students as an active contributor and a concerned citizen.</p>
<p>Students go through differentiated levels of training and mentoring to prepare them for different levels of leadership responsibilities. As part of the developmental process, students are given opportunities to exercise leadership through formal and ad-hoc leadership appointments. They are also given platforms to reflect on their experiences. In addition, teachers provide students with formative feedback through conversations to affirm their strengths and encourage them to work on their areas for growth.</p>
<h4><strong>Programme Objectives</strong></h4>
<p>The vision behind our work in developing students as leaders is to develop within them 21st Century Competencies. Students go through a self- reflective journey to understand what is involved in leadership, and to assess and develop their own abilities. They grow to be more confident and ready to be leaders of today and tomorrow.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Components in the Programme</strong></h4>

<p style="text-align: center;">This diagram depicts the various focuses over three years of a student’s development in MI.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Leadership</strong>&nbsp;sets the foundation for developing leadership potential by focusing on self-mastery and personal effectiveness. It entails developing in students the desire, confidence and capacity to take ownership of one’s own growth and learning based on a keen knowledge of self.</p>
<p><strong>Team Leadership</strong>&nbsp;focuses on developing the students’ social skill of influence such that they are able to lead others with competence and care. A successful team leader strikes a good balance between being people-oriented and task-oriented; he or she inspires productive team performance towards a common goal, by managing conflicts and enabling members to see how they can collaborate and contribute meaningfully to the task.</p>
<p><strong>Community Leadership</strong>&nbsp;focuses on honing students’ capacities to influence and create value through quality insight and innovation, particularly through making a positive change to society. Students are expected to be able to apply fresh perspectives to authentic tasks that are critical to achieving positive outcomes for the community.</p>

<p><strong>Student Leadership Experience<br></strong>This annual event is specially designed for potential CCA leaders and current class leaders. During this event, students participate in both indoor and outdoor team building activities to build and strengthen their collaboration, communication and management skills. After the event, students extend their learning when they apply these skills in planning and executing their CCA action plans. Some student leaders also step up and exercise their leadership skills in the planning and execution of PU1 bonding related activities in the following year.</p>
