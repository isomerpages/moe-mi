<p>&ldquo;My passion for basketball motivates me to excel in the sport. I train with my team mates during our free time after school and have friendly matches over the weekends. Over time, our perseverance paid off as my team and I improved tremendously. In the process,&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve come to&nbsp;view mistakes as opportunities to become better. This perspective has enabled me to keep pushing myself to strive for excellence in everything I do.&rdquo;⁣<br />~ Recipient of the SOF - Peter Lim Scholarship 2021, Singapore Olympic Foundation, Valarie Lim Xin Er (19C2)</p>

<p>&ldquo;I firmly believe that &lsquo;a smooth sea never made a skilled sailor&rsquo;. Two of the biggest challenges I faced on my voyage was the lack of prior experience when I joined MI and having no rulebook to follow when I had to lead my team during the pandemic. Weathering these &lsquo;storms&rsquo; was possible because of the support from my parents, coaches, teachers and teammates. Through the process, I also learnt the importance of staying optimistic through the harshest conditions.&rdquo;<br />~ Recipient of the SOF - Peter Lim Scholarship 2021, Singapore Olympic Foundation, Luqman Hakim Bin Rahmat (19S4)</p>

<p>&ldquo;My team&rsquo;s preparation for the A-Division National School Games was hit hard by the inevitable safe management measures. But it was precisely during these times that our &lsquo;champion&rsquo; mindset shone through. We pushed on with Zoom trainings, using the cones and balls which we brought home for self-practice. I&rsquo;m thankful to my coach, Mr. Robert, for instilling this mindset in me. He taught me that victory was not about defeating one&rsquo;s most formidable foe or winning a much coveted accolade. It is simply a triumph over self, in particular, one&rsquo;s self-imposed limitations.&rdquo;<br />~&nbsp;Recipient of the SOF - Peter Lim Scholarship 2021, Singapore Olympic Foundation &ndash; Eunice Liew Shuyi (19S5)</p>
