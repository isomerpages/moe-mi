<p>The Students' Council is the apex of student leadership in MI. It offers student councilors an array of action platforms to grow their selves, teams and leadership competencies through the planning and implementation of Institute-wide events. Simultaneously, the Students' Council – as representatives of the student body – play a critical role in advocating for, and speaking with, the diverse members of the school community. To be a part of Council, students have to undergo a rigorous development and selection process. This includes School Leadership involvement, Home and Subject Tutor nomination and voting by the student body.</p>

<h4><strong>Key Highlights</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Orientation 2021<br></strong>Student Council just successfully ran Orientation 2021: Amaranthine, which saw us welcoming freshmen to the school and encouraging in them a sense of belonging and school pride. Safe management measures were put in place so students could take part in fun-filled station games while staying safe. The 3-day programme ended on a high with a ‘live’ prize presentation segment, cheers from the classes and clans and a strong sense of camaraderie in the cohort.</p>
