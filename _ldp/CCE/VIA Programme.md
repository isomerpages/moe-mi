<h4><strong>Key Highlights</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structured local VIA Programme</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All students will participate in a class-based VIA project on a yearly basis. Based on the Service-Learning framework, students will acquire the knowledge and skills to propose and implement plans to meet needs in their community through their VIA project. Guidance and support from Home Tutors and teachers in the VIA Committee are provided during this journey. Past projects include an outreach to pre-school children on the importance of environment conservation, and student-initiated VIA projects to various social service agencies.</p>
