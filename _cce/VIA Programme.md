<h4><strong>Key Highlights</strong></h4>

<strong>Structured local VIA Programme</strong>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All students will participate in a class-based VIA project on a yearly basis. Based on the Service-Learning framework, students will acquire the knowledge and skills to propose and implement plans to meet needs in their community through their VIA project. Guidance and support from Home Tutors and teachers in the VIA Committee are provided during this journey. Past projects include an outreach to pre-school children on the importance of environment conservation, and student-initiated VIA projects to various social service agencies.</p>

<strong>Student-initiated VIA Projects</strong> 
<p style="text-align:justify;">To provide ownership, engagement and empowerment, students are encouraged to champion and lead community involvement and environmental projects. This promotes student activism for social and environmental causes that improve the lives of others. Past projects included a buddy reading programme with Delta Senior School, monthly befriending visits to All Saints Home (Jurong), the HP Make IT Green Initiative E-Waste Donation Drive, and fund-raising for a cause as part of the annual Citi-YMCA Youth for Causes in 2017, 2018 and 2020.</p>
