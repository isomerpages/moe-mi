<p style="text-align:justify;">
<strong>Millennia Institute (MI), currently the only Centralised Institute in Singapore, was formed in 2004 from the merger of Jurong Institute (JI) and Outram Institute (OI).</strong></p>

  

<p style="text-align:justify;">MI offers a well-paced GCE 'A' Level programme and is notable for its predominantly classroom-based curriculum delivery as well as close rapport between staff and students. Class sizes are small, averaging 26 in the second and third years of study. MI remains the only educational institution that offers the Business stream for 'A' Level students, which comprises the subjects Principles of Accounting and Management of Business.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Beyond the 'A' Level curriculum, MI also aims to develop students holistically through programmes such as Character and Citizenship Education, Education and Career Guidance, Innovation and Enterprise, Leadership Development, SkillsFuture and MI.World exchanges. These are complemented by the wide range of Co-Curricular Activities offered by MI, some of which are unique to MI and unavailable at other pre-university educational institutions, such as the Angklung Kulintang Ensemble. Physical facilities at MI fully support the dynamism of activities held within MI, and include a sports complex with a running track and an astro-turf hockey pitch.</p>

 <p style="text-align:justify;">To ensure that the best educational environment is created, MI has also implemented a Year Head system, cultivated a strong parent support network, and worked closely with the Institute Advisory Committee to foster effective relationships among students, parents and staff and promote the welfare of the MI Family.</p>
