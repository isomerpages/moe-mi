<p>Millennia Institute (MI) was established in 2004 with the merger of Outram Institute (OI) and Jurong Institute (JI). It became the only Centralised Institute in Singapore, offering a 3-year GCE A-Level course and the Commerce stream, on top of the Arts and Science streams.</p>
<p>OI, the first Centralised Institute to offer the 3-year GCE A-Level course, was founded in 1987, followed by JI in 1989. The merger of JI and OI sought to synergise the resources and expertise of both Institutes to enhance the delivery of a holistic education for students. Between 2004 and 2006, MI operated from two separate campuses at Toh Tuck (former JI campus) and Bartley (former OI campus). MI was relocated to its new single, purpose-built campus at Bukit Batok West Avenue 8 in December 2006.</p>
<p>MI&rsquo;s mission is to nurture students&rsquo; talents to achieve diverse definitions of success beyond the academic. Its signature MI.World Programme equips MI students with a global perspective and cross-cultural skills. Students are also trained in Design Thinking to drive the spirit of innovation. MI Mart, started in 2005, provided opportunities for the real world application of innovation and entrepreneurship potential and eventually evolved into the MI Social Bazaar in 2017. Additionally, self-directed learning programmes, such as the student-led Values in Action, GAP Week, Job Experience and MI SkillsFuture Programme, were introduced to instil in students a sense of autonomy, mastery and purpose in learning for life. These school-wide leadership development opportunities and other co-curricular programmes collectively foster self, team and community leaders of character and values to serve our nation and beyond. MI&rsquo;s Amethyst Talent Programme further supports the holistic development of students by nurturing those with academic aptitude and talents in sports and the arts.</p>
<p>In 2015, the school vision was refined to &lsquo;A Forward-looking Community of Learners, Thinkers and Leaders&rsquo; to reflect the school&rsquo;s focus on preparing students for a world that is volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. MI marked its 15th Anniversary in 2018 with a celebration of its unique position as a place of opportunity and an alternative education pathway to the university.</p>
